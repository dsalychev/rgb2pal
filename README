selected 24-bit RGB. It calculates a distance between two colors in
YUV colorspace in order to find similar ones according to the
"average human perception".

How to install

Running:

	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake .. && make install

from the repository root should generally be enough to install the program.
Please, note that terminal palette won't be installed by default.

In order to find the nearest color to #BC7575 from a palette with 256
terminal colors, run:

	$ rgb2pal bc7575 terminal256.palette
	131 #af5f5f

You'll receive a color with index 131 which value is #AF5F5F.
